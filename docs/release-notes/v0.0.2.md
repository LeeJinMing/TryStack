# v0.0.2

## Highlights

- Recipes: add 10 new A0 “tool apps” (single-container, no external keys).
- Portal: commands now pinned to `v0.0.2` (reproducible runs).
- CLI scaffold template: update pinned example commands to `v0.0.2`.
- CI: increase verify workflow timeout for a larger recipe set.

## Notes

- This release expands the A0 catalog so the Portal has more “ready-to-try” apps.
