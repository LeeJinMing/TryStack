# Decisions / ADRs

We record significant project decisions as **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)**.

## When to write an ADR

Write an ADR when a change:

- Alters the recipe spec or validation rules
- Changes the CLI contract (flags, exit codes, output formats)
- Changes the security model or trust boundaries
- Introduces a new system capability (registry behavior, CI verification strategy)

## How to write one

1. Copy the template: `docs/decisions/ADR-0000-template.md`
2. Name it: `ADR-NNNN-kebab-title.md`
3. Submit as a PR and link the discussion issue.
