# filebrowser (default)

## What you get

- **Try locally**: After startup, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
- **No external keys**: The basic experience does not require any third-party API keys.

## Run

In this directory:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. The default account is often `admin/admin` (follow the upstream docs), and you should change the password on first login.

## Stop

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
